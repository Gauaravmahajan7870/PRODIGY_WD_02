**Interactive Stopwatch App**

I developed a user-friendly stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to start, pause, and reset the stopwatch, while also providing functionality to track and display lap times. The seamless integration of these technologies ensures an efficient and interactive time measurement tool.
